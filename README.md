# ScoreStore
 ASP.NET web application using MVC to track and store wins/losses for any kind of game.
 
This project is my way of refamiliarizing myself with ASP.NET after using it only a few times in university. ScoreStore aims to allow a user to input any game(s) at all of their own choosing into a database. These games are intended to be anything that is played against a few other people such as a video game, card game, or even a sports match.

Once a game is added, the user will then need to manually update their game history as each match occurs. For example, if a user just played a game of basketball against a friend or two, the user will simply add a win or loss to their account for the basketball game they've alredy added. Then, ScoreStore will automatically update the user's win/loss ratio and other useful calcuations to the user in the form of graphs and charts so that he/she better understands their performance.
